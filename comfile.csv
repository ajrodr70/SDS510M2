nlp697k,"You won't have a problem with chicken, vegetable or beef broth overpowering the bison. You are fine to use your normal packaged broth. All will work with the flavor profile in this recipe using Bison. Though Bison does have a slightly different flavor than beef, it is similar enough that it can be interchanged with beef in almost any recipe.//Source: Have cooked Bison, antelope, venison, elk, and bear. I don't really recommend the bear for normal cooking methods. The biggest issue with any of them is that they tend to have less fat than farmed beef. Most of the time I am adding fat in some way when using game meats. //Farmed Bison should have more fat than most meats since most bison is also farmed and fed with grains. I would make your recipe as if using beef the first time. If the meat gets dry and tough during simmering/baking then you need to find a way to add some fat in next time. You could add fats by using ground beef along with the chunk bison, adding in pork belly, or even adding in uncooked bacon. If you use a simmer stage before putting everything in your pie shell you can remove the bacon after simmering. Otherwise, chop it into small pieces and put it in the pie with the bison. //I've also had some success by coating game meats in olive oil and searing them on high heat to seal them before putting in the pie or in the pot to simmer. In this case I'd guess at least some of that flour is going on the meat and the meat is getting seared. Oil is a fine line in this situation. Some oil helps it stick. Too much keeps the flour separated from the meat and it falls apart. If you have issues with the recipe working on the first try my guess is going to be this is the step you need to play with.","Kyrlen",2025-10-27,5,t1_nlozy20,1ohls0t

In a mixing bowl, add ingredients with salt last. Water should be lukewarm, too hot will kill the yeast, too cold will not activate the yeast./2. Mix with a dough hook or by hand until smooth. You may have to add a tidge of water or flour (could be up to a 1/4 cup), depending on the humidity, to make it nice and smooth./3. Spray the top of the dough with cooking spray (lightly) and cover the bowl with a damp cloth. Let rise until doubled in size (about 1 to 2 hours) or in a bag in the refrigerator overnight./4. Form into 2-3 rolls and let rise until almost doubled in size./5. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with seeds of your choice.//Bake rolls - 15 - 18 min.
