You are fine to use your normal packaged broth. All will work with the flavor profile in this recipe using Bison. Though Bison does have a slightly different flavor than beef, it is similar enough that it can be interchanged with beef in almost any recipe.//Source: Have cooked Bison, antelope, venison, elk, and bear. I don't really recommend the bear for normal cooking methods. The biggest issue with any of them is that they tend to have less fat than farmed beef. Most of the time I am adding fat in some way when using game meats. //Farmed Bison should have more fat than most meats since most bison is also farmed and fed with grains. I would make your recipe as if using beef the first time. If the meat gets dry and tough during simmering/baking then you need to find a way to add some fat in next time. You could add fats by using ground beef along with the chunk bison, adding in pork belly, or even adding in uncooked bacon. If you use a simmer stage before putting everything in your pie shell you can remove the bacon after simmering. Otherwise, chop it into small pieces and put it in the pie with the bison. //I've also had some success by coating game meats in olive oil and searing them on high heat to seal them before putting in the pie or in the pot to simmer. In this case I'd guess at least some of that flour is going on the meat and the meat is getting seared. Oil is a fine line in this situation. Some oil helps it stick. Too much keeps the flour separated from the meat and it falls apart. If you have issues with the recipe working on the first try my guess is going to be this is the step you need to play with.\",\"Kyrlen\",2025-10-27,5,t1_nlozy20,1ohls0t\n","\n","nlpbeu7,\"I've made this recipe before (using beef) and it was delicious. //The bison is grass fed and finished, so I don't know how much grain it got during its lifetime (i know that grass fed and finished doesnt mean it never got grain). it does tend to be quite lean.
